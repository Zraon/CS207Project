# CS207Project
CS 207 Project, Candy dispensing robot

Step 1: A solid base

For this project you first will need a rc car that has two dc motors with an h-bridge conection
for both the motors since thats what we have.

With the rc car remove the antena and all the extra stuff that isn't the circuit motors and base
Then you have to remove the integrated circuit thats on the circuit board so you can connect in the arduino
Most will have an RX2 as an integrated circuit if done right the code will work with it. will go into more detail later.
