# CS207Project
##Candy dispensing robot

###Overview
This is a CS207 project. It uses an arduino and various parts to make a remote control car into a candy dispensing robot.
This is a first attempt at robotics and arduino development. This project is more about learning how to make everything work together than about effeicency and ease of use so keep that in mind as you go forward.

###Set-up / Instalation
To have this code work you need an arduino since it uses the arduino code and the servo library for convenience. The robot would need two h-bridges one for motion and one for stearing. It also needs a sonic sensor and a front collision detection system to get the most out of this code.
